/**
 * The `ReversiGame` interface defines the model in a Reversi game.
 * The model is responsible for managing the game state, enforcing game rules, and providing
 * game-related information to other components.

 * Reversi is a two-player board game played on a hexagonal grid where each player
 * aims to have their discs outnumber their opponent's discs by the end of the game.
 * <p>
 * Players take turns placing their disc on the board
 * A valid move requires that a player's disc be placed adjacent to a line of
 * the opponent's discs, with another disc of the player's color at the opposite end.
 * The opponent's discs within this line are then "captured" and flipped to the player's color.
 * If a player has no valid moves, they must pass their turn.
 * The game ends when both players pass consecutively or the board is full.
 * The player with the most discs on the board at the end wins.
 * <p>
 * The game board is a regular grid of hexagonal cells. Initially, an equal number of white and
 * black discs are placed in the center of the grid.
 * Players then add discs to the board during their turn.
 * <p>
 * There are two players, one for each disc color (black and white).
 * Players can be human or computer-controlled.
 * <p>
 * A disc may be placed in any empty cell adjacent to an opponent's disc.
 * If placing a disc forms a line (in any direction) between one of the player's existing discs
 * and the newly placed one, with only the opponent's discs in between,
 * those opponent discs are captured.
 * A player may pass if they wish, but must pass their turn if they have no valid moves available.
